now clone this repo to both pi's in the home folder

git clone https://github.com/robot-websockets/install-update-scripts.git
```

```bash
cd install-update-scripts
```

### Trainbot 1

```bash
bash create-trainbot-1.sh

This is just like installing the code, but now use the update file instead.

Open the install-update-scripts folder in your home folder.

```bash
cd install-update-scripts
```

Run the command:

```bash
bash update-trainbot-1.sh
```

or

```bash
